# Terminal Typing Trainer

A real time terminal typing trainer built in Python using `prompt_toolkit`.

Implements character-level state tracking, delayed error resolution, accurate WPM/accuracy metrics, and an adaptive passage generator that biases future prompts toward empirically weak character n-grams.
